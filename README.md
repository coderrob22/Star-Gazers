## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a webpage using the NASA API: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day). This page receives info from NASA every day. To use this page click on the "Change Date" button which will load the picture and description for the day (from NASA). You can also change the date to another day's picture of the day.

## Lessons Learned:

This was such a fun project to work on and I really enjoyed learning more about fetch requests and working with NASA data. 

## Examples:
Take a look at this example that I have in my portfolio:
